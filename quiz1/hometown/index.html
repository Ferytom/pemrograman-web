      <h1 class="pb-3 mb-3 text-center border-bottom">Etymology</h1>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The etymology of the name Malang is uncertain. One of the
        theory said that the name Malang is derived from the words
        Malangkuçeçwara which means "God has destroyed the false and
        enforced the right". The words was taken from an ancient term
        which mention a legendary temple called Malangkuçeçwara
        supposedly located near the city Malang. The word
        Malangkuçeçwara was applied as the motto of the city of
        Malang. The name "Malang" first appeared on the Pamotoh /
        Ukirnegara Inscription (1120 Saka / 1198 AD) which was
        discovered on 11 January 1975 by a Bantaran plantation
        administrator in Wlingi, Blitar Regency. In the copper
        inscription, one part is written (with the following
        translation) as follows. <br />
        <br />
        ...taning sakrid Malang-akalihan wacid lawan macu pasabhanira
        dyah Limpa Makanagran I...
        <br />
        <br />
        ... in the east where hunting around Malang with wacid and the
        mancu, Dyah Limpa rice fields namely ...
        <br />
        <br />
        Malang here refers to an eastern of Mount Kawi. Although it is
        known that the use of Malang has at least been going on since
        the 12th century, it cannot be ascertained the etymology of
        its territory.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first hypothesis refers to the name of a holy building
        called Malangkuçeçwara (pronounced [malaŋkuʃeʃworo]). The
        sacred building is referred to in two Balitung King
        inscriptions from Ancient Mataram, namely the Mantyasih
        Inscription in 907 AD and the Inscription of 908 AD. Experts
        still have not obtained an agreement where the building is
        located. On the one hand, there are a number of experts who
        say that the Malangkuçeçwara building is located in the Mount
        Buring area, a mountain that stretches east of Malang where
        there is one of its peaks named "Malang". Others on the other
        hand suspect that the actual location of the sacred building
        is in the Tumpang area, Malang Regency. In the area, there is
        a village called Malangsuka, which according to historians
        comes from the word Malangkuça (pronounced [malankuʃoː]) which
        is pronounced upside down. This opinion is reinforced by the
        existence of ancient relics around Tumpang such as Jago Temple
        and Kidal Temple which is the territory of the Kingdom of
        Singhasari.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Malangkuçeçwara name consists of 3 words, namely mala
        which means falsehood, cheating, falsehood, and evil, angkuça
        (pronounced [aŋkuʃo] which means to destroy or destroy, and
        içwara (pronounced [iʃworo]) which means God. Therefore,
        Malangkuçeçwara means "God has destroyed the vanity".
        <br />
        <br />
        The second hypothesis refers to the story of the assault of
        the Mataram Sultanate forces to Malang in 1614 led by
        Tumenggung Alap-Alap. According to folklore, there was a
        conversation between Tumenggung Alap-Alap and one of his
        assistants regarding the condition of Malang before the attack
        began. The assistant from Tumenggung Alap-Alap mentioned
        residents and soldiers from the area as residents who "blocked
        the halangi" ("Malang" in Javanese) from the arrival of
        Mataram troops. After the conquest, the Mataram forces named
        the area of conquest as Malang.

        Early History
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The Malang area in the Pleistocene era was still a deep basin
        flanked by volcanic activity from mountains such as the Karst
        Mountains in the South, Kawi, Butak, and Kelud in the West,
        Anjasmoro, and Arjuno-Welirang complex in the Northeast and
        North, and the Tengger Mountains Complex in East. The basin
        has not been inhabited by humans because the condition is
        still in the form of lava and hot lava flows from the
        surrounding mountains. Towards the rainy season, the Malang
        basin is filled with water flowing through the mountain slopes
        leading to a number of rivers and forming an ancient swamp.
        The swamps spread to create ancient lakes.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the ancient lake had not dried up, early human
        civilization was still in the early to advanced stages of
        Hunting and Collecting Food. The settlements are still on the
        slopes of mountains and mountains that surround Malang in the
        form of natural caves. Therefore, it is understandable that
        the discovery of artifacts in the paleolithic and mesolithic
        period is found in mountainous areas, such as on the slopes of
        Mount Kawi, Arjuno-Welirang, Tengger, Semeru and the Southern
        Karst Mountains.
        <br />
        <br />
        Malang ancient lake gradually dried up in the Holocene era and
        caused the Malang region to become a plateau in Malang. When
        it began to enter the Planting Period, early humans began to
        descend from the mountains and make a number of settlements
        and agricultural areas. The discovery of a number of artifacts
        in the form of two square pickaxes, chalcedony stone tools and
        hand-held andesite axes on the east side of Mount Kawi in the
        Kacuk area around the Metro and Brantas streams reinforced
        this assumption. In addition, the study estimates that the
        forms of occupancy in the transitional period were in the form
        of a stilt house, where the body of the house was supported by
        the legs of the house and was several meters above the ground.
        This is reinforced by the discovery of artifacts in the form
        of "Watu Gong" or "Watu Kenong" in Dinoyo, Lowokwaru, Malang,
        whose forms are similar to traditional musical instruments,
        namely gong, which are actually swear or foundation of a stilt
        house. The growth of settlements around the river flowing in
        Malang became the forerunner of the ancient civilizations of
        the Homo sapiens.
